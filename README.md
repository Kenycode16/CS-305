Artemis Financial, my client for this project, is a financial services company needing secure, dependable software to manage and protect sensitive client data. They approached me to address vulnerabilities in their existing web application, with a particular focus on enhancing data integrity, encryption, and overall system security to protect against unauthorized access and data tampering.

When I identified security vulnerabilities, I took a systematic approach to prioritize and address each issue, documenting each vulnerability and its mitigation strategy. Coding securely is critical because it not only protects sensitive information from breaches but also builds client trust and prevents costly security incidents that could harm the company’s reputation. Security adds immense value to a company's overall well-being by ensuring compliance, fostering trust, and mitigating risks associated with data breaches.

One of the most helpful parts of the vulnerability assessment was performing a dependency check on third-party libraries, as outdated dependencies often pose risks. Adding layers of security included implementing TLS encryption for secure data transmission and a checksum verification process to ensure data integrity. In the future, I’d continue using automated tools like dependency-check and vulnerability scanners, combined with manual code reviews, to assess vulnerabilities and choose appropriate mitigation techniques.

To ensure functionality and security, I performed thorough testing after refactoring the code to verify that all features worked as intended and no new vulnerabilities were introduced. After refactoring, I ran additional vulnerability scans and peer-reviewed the changes to confirm that they did not open up new attack vectors.

Throughout this assignment, I used tools like TLS for encryption, checksum algorithms for data integrity, and secure coding practices to maintain a high level of security. These resources, along with automated security checks, will be invaluable for future projects. To showcase my skills to future employers, I could share examples from this project, such as the vulnerability assessment report, refactoring results, and explanations of how I applied industry-standard security measures to enhance the software's resilience against attacks. This assignment highlights my ability to identify and address security issues, implement secure coding practices, and deliver a secure, functional application.
